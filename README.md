# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Project Description

- A marketing agency wants the codebase for their website to be refactored to follow accessibility guidelines so that it is optimized for search engines. 

- I first switched out the HTML div elements to be semantic elements such as header, nav, main, article, section, aside, and footer. I then changed the CSS classes that were previously assigned to match the HTML selectors. I noticed that many of the classes in the CSS sheet for the same non-semantic HTML elements had the same styling, so I combined those into just HTML selectors in the CSS shheet. I then reordered the CSS elements to follow the same structure as where the corresponding items are located in the HTML.
